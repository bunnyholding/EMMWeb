Your template can also contains Twig functions and filters which can be also used, see your template documentation.

[Twig built-in functions or filters](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/) are also available, for example [url_encode](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/filters/url_encode.html).

## Documentation

### Functions

#### derefererUrl(url)

Masks referer from url address where user is going to be redirected.
Returns string.
```twig
{{ derefererUrl('https://www.google.com/') }}
{# https://dereferer.me/?https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F #}
```

#### trimOnWord(limit, text)

Cuts long texts after whole word. HTML is cut out from text during the process. Works great for shortening meta description. 
Returns string.
```twig
{{ trimOnWord('10', 'A former Roman General sets out to exact vengeance against the corrupt emperor who murdered his family and sent him into slavery.') }}
{# A former Roman General sets out to exact vengeance against #}
```
#### trimOnChar(limit, text)

Cuts long texts on specific character. HTML is cut out from text during the process. Works great for shortening meta description.
Returns string.
```twig
{{ trimOnChar('48', 'A former Roman General sets out to exact vengeance against the corrupt emperor who murdered his family and sent him into slavery.') }}
{# A former Roman General sets out to exact vengean #}
```
#### arraySlice(limit, array, key = false)

Slice array to get first "limit" elements. Works with simple arrays without providing specific key or multidimensional arrays where the key has to be provided.
Returns simple array.
```twig
{{ arraySlice('2', ["Morocco", "Italy", "USA", "Serbia"]) }}
{# ["Morocco", "Italy"] #}
    
{{ arraySlice('2', [["id" => 1, "name" => "Action"], ["id" => 2, "name" => "Drama"], ["id" => 8, "name" => "Adventure"]], 'name') }}
{# ["Action", "Drama"] #}
```
#### renderIfEverythingIsNotEmpty(template, variables)

Renders template but only if every variable in template exists and is not empty.
Similar to PHP [vsprintf](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.vsprintf.php). Returns string.
```twig
{{ renderIfEverythingIsNotEmpty('Rated %%s/%%s', [8.2, 10]) }}
{# Rated 8.2/10 #}

{# Examples where empty string will be returned #}
{{ renderIfEverythingIsNotEmpty('Rated %%s/%%s', [0, 10]) }}
{{ renderIfEverythingIsNotEmpty('Rated %%s/%%s', ['', 10]) }}
```

### Filters
#### delimiter

Appends delimiter after variable/block if it is not empty. Returns string.
```twig
{{ 'Gladiator'|delimiter }}
{# Gladiator. #}
```
#### comma

Join array elements with a comma and space. Works same as Twig [join](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/filters/join.html) with ', ' as separator. Returns string.
```twig
{{ ["Action", "Drama"]|comma }}
{# Action, Drama #}
```

## Examples
See examples how it could look like when you use functions and filters in Twig template together with variables.

To evaluate final render results, let's say variable _item_ contains these values: 
```json
{"name":"X-Men","rating":{"value":"7.4","weight":537121,"scale":10},"releasedYear":2000,"countries":[{"id":1,"name":"USA","code":"US"}],"genres":[{"id":1,"name":"Action"},{"id":2,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":10,"name":"Sci-Fi"}],"description":"In a world where mutants (evolved super-powered humans) exist and are discriminated against, two groups form for an inevitable clash: the supremacist Brotherhood, and the pacifist X-Men."}
```
Then rendering the following templates will return these:
```twig
&#127902; Watch/download {{ item.name }} {{ renderIfEverythingIsNotEmpty('&#11088;%%s/%%s', [item.rating.value, item.rating.scale])|delimiter }} {{ arraySlice('3', item.genres, 'name')|comma|delimiter }} {{ trimOnWord('20', item.description) }}
{# üéû Watch/download X-Men ‚≠ê7.4/10. Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi. In a world where mutants (evolved super-powered humans) exist and are discriminated against, two groups form for an inevitable clash: .. #}

HD Stream &#128250; {{ item.name|delimiter }} {{ item.releasedYear }}
{# HD Stream üì∫ X-Men - 2000 #}

Download {{ item.name|delimiter }} {{ arraySlice('2', item.countries, 'name')|comma|delimiter }} {{ item.releasedYear|delimiter }} {{ arraySlice('3', item.genres, 'name')|comma }}
{# Download X-Men. USA. 2000. Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi #}

https://google.com?q={{ ('Download ' ~ item.name)|url_encode }}
{# https://google.com?q=Download%20X-Men #}
```
